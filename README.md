# Large-Scale Prior Fields via SPDEs

LS-Prior is a python package for large-scale Gaussian prior measures. The implementation is based on the SPDE approach to Gaussian Matérn fields popularized by
[Lindgren et al.](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.00777.x).
This work introduces the generation of random fields via transformations of white noise $W$ by an elliptic operator, resembled by equations of the form

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \tau (\kappa^2 - \Delta)^{\nu/2} = W.
\end{equation*}
$$

The discrete representation of prior distributions in LS-Prior on computationl meshes is realized through the finite element method with [FenicsX](https://fenicsproject.org/). The package is
intended to be a more modern, modular, and flexible substitute for the prior component in the [hIPPYlib](https://hippylib.github.io/) library. In particular, it can be combined with any other component in an inverse problem workflow, without explicit reliance on the internal FEM
representation.

### Key Features
- **Matrix-free Gaussian prior distributions via SPDE approach**
- **FenicsX FEM backend, PETSc linear algebra and solvers**
- **Fully MPI parallelized, fully modular**
- **Easily embeddable into Bayesian inverse problem workflows**

## Getting Started

LS-Prior is available as a conda package on [Prefix](https://prefix.dev/channels/kruse-forge/packages/ls-prior). To install the package, simply run
```bash
conda install -c https://repo.prefix.dev/kruse-forge ls-prior
```

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://maximilian-kruse.github.io/LS-Prior/) provides further information regarding usage, technical setup and API. Alternatively, you can check out the notebooks under [`examples`](https://github.com/maximilian-kruse/LS-Prior/tree/main/examples)
